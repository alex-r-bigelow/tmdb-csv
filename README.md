# tmdb-scraper

A simple script for downloading movies as CSVs from TMDB

### Setup

- Install `node.js`; the best way to do this is usually via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```
git clone git@github.com:alex-r-bigelow/tmdb-scraper.git
cd tmdb-scraper
npm install

./getTmdbData.mjs --help
```

You will need to sign up for a TMDB API key, that you should supply as the `--key` argument.
